# Population

Population is a genetic algorithm simulation of interaction between two populations, hunter and prey.

The simulation runs generations. Each population generation creates a new, child generation, using genetic algorithms (GA) for selection, crossover, and mutation. During the lifetime of a generation, each hunter individual tries to eat a prey individual within reach.

This is an exercise in Java and game building.
